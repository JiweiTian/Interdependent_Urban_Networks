# Interdependent_Urban_Networks
Modeling and robustness evaluation of Interdependent urban utility networks

### Description
This project develops a Hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) based modeling framework for the interdependent urban infrastructures followed by an analysis of network robustness.  Robustness is accessed by simulating various attacks on the process relation graph that maps interdependency among the processes(functionalities). The proposed methodology is tested using a conceptual interdependent network, comprising of an 38-node power distribution system, a 30-node water distribution network, a district heating network, a natural gas system and a road trans-portation network. 

### Folder structure
* System diagrams: Includes standard test networks corresponding to Power, Water, Transportation, Gas and Heating services. 
* Process relation matrix: Contains process relation matrix for 43 and 121 processes.
* Scripts: Includes all the python scripts used in robustness analysis.
